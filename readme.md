# Hands-on Tutorial for ST 201 415 (Introduction to Data Science)

This is a collection of all hands-on tutorials for the course 
"Introduction to Data Science" at Institut Teknologi Kalimantan. 
This tutorial provides with the following topics:
- Introduction to Python with specific reviews for data science
- Basic usage of numpy, matplotlib, and pandas
- Visualization with matplotlib for boxplot, histogram, and scatterplot
- Time series dataset in stock prices; resistence and support lines
- Data smoothing algorithms
- Exploratory techniques with median polish
- Visualizing count data regressions using rootogram
- A basic principle of machine learning
- Classification with SVM, KNN, and Decision tree
- Regression with OLS, Ridge, and Bayessian regression
- Dimensional reduction with PCA
- Machine learning evaluation metric: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, cross
  validation
- Capstone project example in Machine Learning:
  - Hitting the Bottle (Mullind, 2022) Chapter 8
  - Machine Learning for Energy Management Optimization (Barton and Müller)

The following references are not used in the above topics, but help me
to provide a clear explanation and some demonstrations how to impelement
them in Python
